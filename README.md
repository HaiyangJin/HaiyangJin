Iâ€™m Haiyang Jin, currently a postdoc in [Dr. Olivia Cheungâ€™s lab](https://www.oliviacheunglab.org/) at the New York University Abu Dhabi:united_arab_emirates:. I obtained my PhD in Psychology with the supervision of [Prof. William G. Hayward](http://www.socsc.hku.hk/bio/Hayward.htm), [Assoc/Prof. Paul M. Corballis](https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/p-corballis), and [Assoc/Porf. Sam S. Schwarzkopf](https://sampendu.net/sam-schwarzkopf/) at the University of Auckland, New Zealand:new_zealand:. 

I'm interested in understanding face processing:upside_down_face: and vision sciences:monocle_face: with psychophysics, EEG/ERP, fMRI:brain: and eye-tracking:eyes:. You can find more about me [here](https://haiyangjin.github.io/en/about/).

I'm also a big fan of statistics:1234:, especially linear mixed-effects modeling and Bayesian hierarchical modeling. I'm currently working on a Bayesian meta-analysis:books: with seletion models to take into account publication bias. 

Feel free to [contact me](https://haiyangjin.github.io/en/contact/):mailbox: for anything.
